Project Description:
FLASHLET
A simple flashcard application. Allows you to create new flashcard sets with terms and definitions, and test yourself on that set. 

Instructions
  On the home page, hit New Set to create a new set and follow the given prompts. Once you have created the set you wish to study, or if it already exists, select Load Set and click the name of the set. Then select Quiz or Learn. These are two different studying modes. Quiz is two flash cards where you can reveal the definition. If you see a word you really don't know, star it and it will appear again later.Learn is where you must type in the correct definition for the word. If you don't know the word at all, simply leave the box blank and hit enter.
What Works/Doesn't

Data Structures
 We use a queue we built for all quizzing in both Quiz and Learn.
